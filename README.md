# Djikstra's Algorithm

This is an implementation of Djikstra's algorithm to solve the problem of "the shortest path between two places". This folder contains, as an example, a file with the desired routes `routes.txt`, one with the available paths (just for illustration purposes) `map.txt`, a file with some packages in the format `source destination` called `packages.txt` and a file that specifies the distances between the nodes `paths.txt`.

In this example the script calculates the shortest distance to deliver a package from a city to another. The cities are SF, WS, LS, and BC.

# Tests

`tests.py` contains a simple test to ensure that the algorithm works as intended.
